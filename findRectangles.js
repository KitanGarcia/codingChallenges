/*
Given a rectangle represented by a 0-1 2-d array and assume it contains one rectangle of all 0, return the upper left corner and lower right corner.
Example:
[[1,1,1,1,1],
[1,0,0,1,1],
[1,0,0,1,1],
[1,1,1,1,1]], you should return [[[1,1],[2,2]]]

Followup, what if there are multiple rectangles that are made of 0, return all.
Example:
[[1,1,1,1,1],
[1,0,0,1,1],
[1,0,0,1,1],
[1,1,1,1,0]], you should return [[[1,1],[2,2]],[[3,4],[3,4]]]
